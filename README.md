## Hi,
My name is Rohith Malangi, I am a Computer Science student who loves learning about new technologies, building projects, and improving my problem-solving skills. I am particularly interested in leveraging software to combat environmental challenges.
I'm currently working on a project to optimize computer vision models for edge devices, specifically for wildfire detection. 
I'm also trying to familiarize myself with the latest generative AI software development tools to code faster.

I'm currently looking for full-time roles in software engineering so if you know of any, definitely hit me up!

Fun fact: I'm on a Indian fusion dance team
